snapaid
=======

This is a utility that will make it easier to find and download the
correct snapshot.  It will also fetch and verify the GPG signature
and hash of the snapshot to ensure that you are getting the correct
file.

The only file needed for this is the snapaid.sh script.  The other files
are used for generating the index.
